<ul>

 <li>Consider the advantages and disadvantages of a code management and deployment solution given a set of project guidelines.</li>

</ul>

Familiarize yourself with setting up a project environment on the code management and deployment solution of your choice.

<ul>

 <li>Work in groups to judge the best possible solution given a set of project guidelines.</li>

</ul>

<strong>Instructions: </strong>

<ul>

 <li>With your group:</li>

 <li>Choose a Version Control Repository for your project.</li>

 <li>You will be using this repository for your individual/group tutorials and project deliverables.</li>

 <li>Though you will be deciding on a control repository with your group, you will be setting up your own individual environment for this activity.</li>

 <li>Setup a main repository for your group, this is the repository where all members of your group would be expected to contribute their code.</li>

 <li>Create a branch to this main repository for each member of your group.</li>

 <li>Setup your (front-end) project environment on the repository (i.e., tutorial2).</li>

 <li>Test that each member of your group can successfully push some code to the master repository. This step is meant to be for testing purposes, rather than for quality, the Instructors and TAs want to make sure that your group is able to setup and collaborate with each other, using the version control repository that your group has chosen.</li>

 <li>Deploy your project environment on Heroku.</li>

 <li>You will be deploying a generic project environment, this way we can help make sure any issues you might encounter are resolved.</li>

 <li>Only the initial project setup should be live on deployment link.</li>

 <li>Ensure your tutorial displays something, e.g., displaying an “It works” message or boilerplate code from frontend frameworks would suffice</li>

</ul>
